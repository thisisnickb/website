Using psychological, sociological, and anthropological data, we propose a coping model of gun ownership, in which gun owners (especially those for whom personal protection is paramount) may be using their guns as a form of physicalized self-affirmation - as a way to manage the psychological  threats (such as threats to belonging) they face in everyday life."
