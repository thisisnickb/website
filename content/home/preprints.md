Here is a selection of papers that are currently in progress. While we're very excited about them of course, we ask that you do not cite anything on this page until the peer-review process has completed its work.

* [Historical prevalence of slavery predicts contemporary American gun ownership] (files/BMp062022.pdf), *with Jessica Mazen.* In this manuscript, we find that that American protective gun culture starts to cohere with the status-threat to White Americans arising from Emancipation and Reconstruction. Using data on every death in America from 1996-2016, nationally-representative survey data from over 3.5 million Americans, and the geographic relationship between every American Facebook friendship, we show that the intensity of enslavement in a county in 1860 predicts contemporary White gun ownership, and patterns of gun ownership outside the South can be predicted by a county’s degree of social-connectedness to counties with higher rates of historical enslavement. We further find that contemporary felt safety of residents in the county mediates the relationship between historical intensity of enslavement and contemporary gun ownership, and the more socially-connected a given county is to one that had high rates of historical enslavement, the stronger the relationship between feelings of safety and gun ownership. **Draft current as of June 17, 2022**
* ['A true friend with six hearts': Holding a firearm helps gun-owners deal with the threat of electric shock] (files/BMWp102021.pdf), *with Sara Medina DeVilliers & Xiaowen Wang.* In this manuscript describing a preregistered experiment, we find that when expecting a painful electric shock, participants from gun-owning households felt more calm (as indicated by their physiological responses) when holding a non-firing pistol than holding a control object, whereas those from non-gun-owning households felt less calm when handling the gun. **Draft current as of October 12, 2021**
* [Shifts in residential mobility predict shifts in culture] (files/BYOp092021.pdf), *with Youngjae Cha & Shigehiro Oishi.* In this manuscript, we use representative cross-national data from 18 industrialized nations to show that in years when residential mobility is lower than usual in a country, citizens are less likely to say that hard work leads to success, are less optimistic, and less individualistic; findings that are echoed in microdata from a nationally representative sample both of Americans who have successfully moved and those who wished to move but were in the same location a year later. **Draft current as of September 3, 2021**
* [Worries about appearing prejudiced decreased among conservatives after the 2016 election of Donald Trump] (files/BBMp092021.pdf), *with Hyeonjin Bak & Jessica Mazen.* In this manuscript describing a preregistered analysis of data from over 90,000 visitors to the Project Implicit website over four years (2015-2018) we find that conservatives (but not liberals) reduced the degree to which they reported being motivated to avoid responding with prejudice for external reasons – finding, in other words, that conservatives in the Trump era felt less constricted by political correctness or the approbation of their peers when expressing their prejudices. This reduction in the external motivation to avoid responding with prejudice mediated the relationship between political orientation and explicit racial attitudes, and that the weakening of conservatives’ external motivation to control their prejudice in the age of Trump predicted changes in their explicit attitudes (i.e. moderated mediation). We find, furthermore, that this pattern of results is unique to the external motivation to avoid acting with prejudice, not anti-prejudice motivations more generally (as the internal motivation to avoid responding with prejudice were not differentially affected by the Trump era across the political divide). **Draft current as of September 23, 2021**
* [False growth mindsets in teachers negatively impact student beliefs and achievement] (files/BSWp012021.pdf), *with David Silverman & Stephanie Wormington.* In this manuscript describing a preregistered analysis of a nationally representative sample of over 3,800 9th-graders and more than 300 of their mathematics teachers in over 60 public schools, we find that false-growth-mindset beliefs in teachers are widespread and come with motivational and academic consequences for students in these classrooms, including viewing their teachers as having ‘fixed’ ability beliefs and holding entity theories about their own intelligence, both of which predict lowered end-of-year grades. **Draft current as of January 11, 2021**
